  of the current folder or a selected folder. The software scans
  for icons in the My Pictures directory.
  

  __Documentation__
  -------------

  When a folders' icon is set, the program copies the selected
  icon to an application data folder and points the desktop.ini 
  to that copied file.

  __Installation__

  registry entries that aren't set by the software at the moment.
